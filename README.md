# Simon Game

A browser‑based “Simon” memory game built with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML & CSS. The game presents an ever‑growing sequence of button presses (colors + sounds) that the player must repeat in order.

## 🚀 Features

  Each level, the game adds one random color to the pattern.

  Players repeat the sequence by clicking colored buttons.

  Each button press (game‑ and user‑initiated) plays a sound and flashes the button.

  The current level is displayed and increments on each successful round.
- **Game Over Handling**  
  Wrong clicks trigger a “game over” sound/animation and reset the game.
